# Bitrise Xcode: Unit Test Step With Kif

As described in the [Unit Test section](/tutorials/xcode-unit-test.html) you can simply run the unit tests you created for your project during every or branch specific builds on Bitrise just by adding the ***Xcode: Unit Test*** step to your workflow. 

Running unit tests that were created using [Kif](https://github.com/kif-framework/KIF) is not much more complex.

[Kif](https://github.com/kif-framework/KIF) can be installed using CocoaPods and after installing it you can simply run the tests you created the same way as before.

>Remember to set the target for the pod in your podfile 
    
    target :SuchAppTests, :exclusive => true do
    	pod 'KIF'
    end

>or link the original and test targets so the tests can use the framework
    
    link_with 'SuchApp', 'SuchAppTests'
    pod 'KIF'

This means you simply have to add the ***Run CocoaPods install*** step [https://github.com/bitrise-io/steps-cocoapods-and-repository-validator](https://github.com/bitrise-io/steps-cocoapods-and-repository-validator) and after that step you can run the ***Xcode: Unit Test*** to run your [Kif](https://github.com/kif-framework/KIF) based tests.

Just like at the ***Xcode Unit Test*** step if there were no errors during the test the Formatted Output will show the following message:
    
    Success

If there were errors the following message is added to the Formatted Output:
    
    Error 
    Error Description:
    Xcode 'unittest' Action Failed
    See the logs for more information


There is a simple test project available at [https://bitbucket.org/bazscsa/scarybug](https://bitbucket.org/bazscsa/scarybug) You can simply try by adding the app and adding the ***Xcode: Unit Test*** step [https://github.com/bitrise-io/steps-xcode-builder](https://github.com/bitrise-io/steps-xcode-builder) and the ***CocoaPods install*** step [https://github.com/bitrise-io/steps-cocoapods-and-repository-validator](https://github.com/bitrise-io/steps-cocoapods-and-repository-validator)
